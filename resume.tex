\section{Experience}
\cventry{Oct 2014 - Present}{Software engineer/Product owner}{En Japan}{Tokyo}{}{Work on HR services using Ruby on Rails for web services and Scala Spark distributed system for machine learning and analysis. Designed a modular micro service architecture used by all services in the team on AWS infrastructure such as VPC, ELB, Elastic Beanstalk and RDS. Created and managed a project with up to 10 people.}
\cventry{Jun 2010 - Sept 2014}{Lead Developer}{Orange Labs}{Tokyo}{}{Created services in partnership with Japanese actors to find opportunities between Orange and the local technology industry. For each project, I designed, defined the market offer, prototyped the solution leading small teams of designers and developers and finally pushed the product to sponsors in the group and to local partners.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Created a prototype and a market offer for a real time control system of QoS for LTE connections. This was an opportunity to interact with a huge infrastructure, LTE SAE, and learn how to dive into complex standards to create innovative solutions.
    \item End to end designed and prototyped a content delivery solution using 802.11ad in partnership with Wilocity that resulted in the Media Station Kiosk product in collaboration with SITA (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uNkvKtkCNI).
    \item Collaborated with Les Bains Numeriques festival in France to develop a mobile application to follow other visitors, 6th sens (http://6emesens.orangejapan.jp), and an installation with real time video streaming projected in immersive spheres. This was the occasion to find technical solutions to implement more artistic projects.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{Apr 2012 - Dec 2013}{CTO and Co-Founder}{Smint Co.,Ltd.}{Tokyo}{}{Co-created a company making a mobile application related to fashion. Starting a company taught me a lot about human relationships and shaped my vision of product creation and business development.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{fukupix}: fashion mobile SNS that enables its community to share their style and find easily where to buy clothing items (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oEnScbas4). I led the architecture design, user experience workflows and implemented the iOS app and api server (with Scala and Lift). I learnt then about ObjectiveC and reactive programming thanks to ReactiveCocoa. I also learnt a lot about functional programming and the use of the cake pattern as an alternative to dependency injection frameworks.
    \item \textit{onecard}: mobile wallet for loyalty cards. Led the architecture design and implemented iOS and Android apps and their backend server (with Scala and Play). During this period I learnt a lot about asynchronous and actor based programming.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventry{Jun 2009 - Jan 2010}{Intern Engineer}{Orange Labs}{Tokyo}{}{Worked on route prediction algorithm using Lucene index and Google Maps API. During this
period I have acquired experience of main design patterns such as MVC, Dependency Injection using Spring framework.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Extra: Moved scattered hardware based IT structure in the lab to a unified virtual machines solution using Google ganeti server management system and created a common internal application deployment environment thanks to LDAP, git, internal DNS, reverse proxy Nginx and task management based on Redmine.
  \end{itemize}
}
